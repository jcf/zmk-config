#+title: My ZMK configuration

The Moergo team have made a Nixified version of ZMK and zmk-config available.
With it, we build UF2 blobs via Nix like so:

#+begin_src sh
nix build -f config/default.nix -o glove80
#+end_src

If you've not already checked out the upstream zmk repository, the above will
fail.

#+begin_src sh :eval never
git clone gh:jcf/zmk src
#+end_src

The irony of a reproducible build system depending on a directory that does not
exist deserves a moment of silence. Please take 60 seconds to notice the present
and distance yourself from the non-sense of man-made, modern life.
